## FAQ
#### *"How does it work?"* <br> 
**First off it gets all the details from the staff members and players! Then after that it will, on command, initate a round inviting all the people that was assigned to be playing in that round. The way it invites people is VIA macro which is where the bot get's use at ur own risk. For the stats it reads your latest.log file and parses it line by line!**
<br>
#### *"Why should I tust it?"* <br>
**All the code is open source and at the end it is not even in an exe you can still view the code :)**
<br>
#### *"I have a question about this project"* <br>
**Fire me a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cryptizism) or on Discord (Cryptizism#2999)**
<br>
#### *"What does the bat do?"* <br>
**The `start.bat` file installs all of the dependancies and makes it run, this is for less tech literate users üëçüèø**
## Bugs
#### Robustness
- [ ] If player disconnects/lags out the bot may break
